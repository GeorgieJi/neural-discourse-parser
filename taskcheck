deal with nan

1. what cause it?

2. where i can find it?

3. which symbolic varialbe lead to the inf or nan?


collected solution:
case1: gradient inf -> gradient clip


case2: softmax + crossentropy -> inf

softmax exp(x_k)/sum(exp(x_k)) -> 0
crossentropy ylogp + (1-y)log(1-p) when p = 0, and y = 1, ylogp may be the inf

case3: the theano softmax problem
the problem goes away if you explicitly write out the softmax function instead of using theano's :
